                    <p class="lead">We are Team 5104, a <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition (FRC) team from Pacific Grove,
                        California known as the BreakerBots. Coach Roby Hyde started our team in 2013 with the goal of
                        providing a welcoming space for students who shared an interest in STEM. Since then, our team has
                        grown to about 8 mentors and 35 active students, with over 1/3 of them women or non binary. Our focus
                        has expanded beyond science as well; we now have students working on business, project management,
                        communications, art and team spirit.
                        <br><br>Although we meet year-round, our busiest time begins in January when we have just six weeks to design and build
                        a robot that can compete in a specifically designed robot game. We typically enter two regional competitions in
                        California each year, and we have qualified for the FIRST World Championships in Houston, Texas twice in the past five years.
                        This year, we competed in, FIRST’s unique “varsity sport for the mind."</p>
