                        <p class="lead"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last weekend, the Breakerbots competed at the San
                            Francisco Regional, our second regional of the season. We saw a big
                            improvement in performance compared to Pinnacles, pushing through several electrical and
                            mechanical challenges along the
                            way. Thanks to the team's hard work and quick problem-solving, we finished ranking 12th
                            overall and were proud to serve
                            as the 8th seed alliance captain. Although we lost a tough match to the 5th seed alliance
                            by just 4 points, we were
                            honored to receive the Gracious Professionalism Award for supporting other teams and
                            bringing a positive spirit
                            throughout the event.
                            <br>Now, we’re back at work, fine-tuning our code and dialing in on drive practice as we get
                            ready
                            for our final event of the
                            season—the <a href="https://cafirst.org/frc/contracosta/">Contra Costa Regional</a>, taking
                            place March 27–30 at Pittsburg High School. We’re
                            feeling strong and excited to hit the field one more
                            time—we hope to see you there!

                    <p class="lead"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That time of the week again—it's the end of Week 10,
                        and the Breakerbots are making big strides! This week, we finalized
                        our completely new end effector system and indexer, assembling both and putting them to
                        test. Now, our focus is on
                        fine-tuning the power delivery to the end effector, working to find the best solution to
                        keep the e-chain stable. On top
                        of that, we’ve finished preparing all our spare parts to ensure we’re fully equipped for the
                        challenges ahead. With
                        these improvements, we’re feeling confident and excited as we gear up for our next regional
                        competition—let’s keep the
                        momentum going!

                        our goal was to make major improvements to our design. Within these past weeks,
                        we have completely redesigned our end-effector and refined our ground intake subsystem.
                        We have also been working to improve our robot’s autonomous performance,
                        where the robot functions without a driver’s input. In all, we have significantly improved
                        our robot
                        for our next competition on March 27-30th, the Contra Costa Regional at Pittsburg High

                        regional event of the season: Pinnacles Regional, hosted by Deep-Space Robotics at
                        Hollister High School. After weeks of preparation, we were excited to hit the field and
                        compete alongside so many
                        talented teams. It was an intense and thrilling event, and we were proud to earn the role of
                        8th seed alliance captain,
                        teaming up with the Churrobots and Monta Vista Robotics to secure two hard-fought wins. On
                        top of that, we were honored
                        to receive the Judge’s Award, recognizing our team’s unique efforts and impact. A huge thank
                        you to our mentors,
                        sponsors, and everyone who came out to support us—your energy and encouragement mean the
                        world. We can’t wait to take
                        what we’ve learned and keep pushing forward in the season ahead!

                        everyone to test their robots. During the event, our team made significant progress,
                        fine-tuning subsystems and
                        improving performance. The programming team have also made impressive strides with the
                        development of
                        our autopaths, ensuring a
                        strong autonomous period, and began work on our intelligent vision system. With our
                        preparations in full swing, we’re

                        forward for the Breakerbots! This week, we wrapped up work on our
                        Development Robot and have officially shifted our focus to building the final designs for
                        our competition robot,
                        Leviathan. While the build team gets to work, the drive team has been sharpening their
                        skills with continued practice,
                        now using a mock field to simulate real match conditions. We’re also looking forward to
                        hosting the Week 0 Scrimmage for
                        local teams on February 22, giving everyone a chance to test their robots in a real-game
                        environment. Exciting progress

                            progress! We’re almost finished with Bravo Bot, and all we need to do is
                            finish the shooter and hopper then mount everything onto the chassis. After a lot of hard
                            work, the programmers can
                            finally be able to start working on Bravo, and bring the robot to life with code. It’s a big
                            milestone, and we’re eager
                            to get started on the next phase, beginning to design and build our final competition robot,

                        This week, we successfully mounted our robot climber and intake, and handed it off to the
                        programming team. The
                        programmers have been working tirelessly to fine-tune the robot, making adjustments to
                        ensure optimal performance.
                        Meanwhile, the drive team has been practicing in the Student Union, getting more comfortable
                        with the drive train by
                        each day. Once we have the full practice field set up, and once Bravo Bot has been finished,
                        they’ll be able to run more
                        advanced drills, including climbing the tower and shooting into the hub. Everyone is working

                        great progress on our development robots.
                        With Alpha bot fully wired, our electrical team has
                        begun to wire Bravo bot, our second development robot.
                        Our design has an intake that pivots out of our robot to pick up
                        game pieces, and feeds them into a hopper which stores
                        them and feeds them into the shooter, which can shoot multiple
                        game pieces at a time anywhere on the field. Finally, our
                        robot has an elevator with a hook, allowing it to climb onto
                        the side rungs of this year’s tower. Next, we’ll finish
                        the electrical work and hand the robot off to programming for
                        testing and refinement. At the same time, the CAD team is
                        hard at work creating the final design for Nausicaa, our final
                        robot which we will take to competitions. Everyone has
                        contributed their skills and effort, and the excitement is
                        building as we bring Nausicaa closer to completion!

                <h2 class="featurette-heading"> Week 1: Prototyping
                    <p class="lead"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Week 1, the BreakerBots worked on CAD
                        and prototypes for their 2026 robot. The team prototyped many different
                        designs for the fuel intake, and the shooter, and are working on finalizing design
                        decisions for these tasks. The CAD
                        team started making models of these mechanisms as well as a master sketch of our
                        final robot, and our mechanical team
                        assembled the robot’s chassis and wired it. Finally, on January 17th, BreakerBots
                        participated in the 2026 Chartwell
                        Review with other local teams. Now, our software team will start programming the
                        drive train, and the team will continue
                        refining prototypes for our new robot.

                <h2 class="featurette-heading"> Week 0: Kickoff
                    <p class="lead"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year’s game event, Rebuilt, started off with a
                        blast revealing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fybREErgyM" target="_blank">a new
                            game</a>,
                        new challenges, and new robot opportunities, and we are eager to step up to the challenge!
                        This fall, we gained many new members, bringing our total to over 20 teammates,
                        all of whom are excited to get the build season started. <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a new game comes new rules, designs, and ideas, so our first
                        task
                        was to become familiar
                        with the rules.
                        In short, our robot must pick up balls, shoot those balls into our alliance hub,
                        and be able to climb onto a tower with
                        3 levels of height. Once we understood the game, we came up with designs,
                        strategies, and concepts to help us create the
                        most optimal robot to achieve these tasks.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After kickoff day, we will have 9 weeks before heading off to the
                        San Francisco District Event to face
                        off against many competitive teams.
                        Be sure to come back next week for the BreakerBots Week 1 Recap!
