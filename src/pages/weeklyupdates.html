                <p class="lead"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Silicon Valley Regional,
                    our goal was to make major improvements to our design. Within these past weeks,
                    we have replaced our shooter rack, and added an additional arm onto our robot.
                    We have also been working to improve our robot’s autonomous performance,
                    where the robot functions without a driver’s input. In all, we have significantly improved our robot for our
                    next competition, Monterey Bay Regional, at Seaside High School from March 28-30th. We would love to have you
                    come and cheer on the BreakerBots!

                <p class="lead"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In week 7 we continued programming Typhoon’s main mechanisms.
                    While the programmers worked, the rest of the team prepared for the weekend’s scrimmage, which we hosted for local teams.
                    Our programming subteam got to use a full field for the whole weekend, while five of the other teams in the area got a chance
                    to test their robots. We were even able to run multiple full matches together!
                    Next week, we’ll be preparing for the real deal, Silicon Valley Regional in Santa Clara, March 1st through 3rd.

                <p class="lead"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the last week, we’ve all been hard at work during our break from school to finish up our work on Typhoon.
                    Since last weekend, Typhoon can complete all aspects of the game, including intaking and shooting game pieces and climbing.
                    We’ve also taken measures to improve the robot, replacing our original intake and amp-scoring mechanisms with updated versions.
                    Next week, our programmers will continue to refine and tune the mechanisms while the rest of the team prepares to host a scrimmage
                    with local teams in the student union, to take place on Feb 24.

                        <p class="lead"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week, the Breakerbots made some exciting
                            progress! We focused on fine-tuning our Development Robot, making huge
                            improvements to the intake, indexer, elevator, and climber to ensure everything runs
                            smoothly. After a lot of hard work,
                            the programmers can finally begin their work, and bring the robot to life with
                            code. It’s a big milestone,
                            and we’re eager to get started on the next phase, beginning to design and build our final
                            competition robot, Leviathan! Stay tuned for more
                            updates as we keep pushing
                            forward!

                <h2 class="featurette-heading" style="color: #666;"> Week 4: Wrapping Up Devbot
                    <p class="lead"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week, we successfully completed our development
                        robot and handed it off to the programming team. The programmers
                        have been working tirelessly to fine-tune the robot, making adjustments to ensure optimal
                        performance.
                        Meanwhile, the drive team is getting ready to start practice in the Student Union. For now,
                        they’ll focus on getting
                        comfortable with the robot, but once we have the full practice field set up, they’ll be able
                        to run more advanced
                        drills. Everyone is working hard, and with competition season getting closer, we’re excited
                        to see all the pieces coming
                        together!

                <h2 class="featurette-heading" style="color: #666;"> Week 3: Wiring
                    <p class="lead"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week, we’ve made great progress on our
                        development robot. The team completed the mechanical assembly and started
                        wiring on Wednesday. Our design has an intake that pivots out of our robot to pick up game
                        pieces, and puts them through
                        the indexer and into the arm on an elevator, which can place game pieces anywhere on the
                        field. Finally, our robot has a
                        grabber and a winch to allow it to climb on a swinging cage. Next, we’ll finish the
                        electrical work and hand the robot
                        off to programming for testing and refinement. At the same time, the CAD team is hard at
                        work fine-tuning designs and
                        making adjustments to improve Leviathan’s performance. Everyone has contributed their skills
                        and effort, and the
                        excitement is building as we bring Leviathan closer to completion!

                <h2 class="featurette-heading" style="color: #666;"> Week 2: Manufacturing
                    <p class="lead"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During week 2, the BreakerBots honed in on the robot’s
                        design, machining and assembling prototypes–and finalized
                        mechanisms. Thus far, the team has tested two different game piece intakes on the
                        development robot, one for picking up
                        the large playground balls (algae) and the other for intaking the pipes (coral). An elevator
                        system has also been
                        assembled for our devbot, alongside a climbing mechanism and game piece indexer, and we’re
                        hoping to test these systems
                        next week. Machining began for the mechanism to place coral as well. Devbot has also been
                        great for the programming
                        team, as they’ve gotten a stronger sense of the full robot and can more easily pre-program.

                <h2 class="featurette-heading" style="color: #666;"> Week 1: Prototyping
                    <p class="lead"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During Week 1, the Breakerbots worked on CAD and
                        prototypes for their 2025
                        robot, “Leviathan”. The team prototyped many different designs for the algae intake, the
                        coral intake, and the climb
                        and finalized design decisions for these tasks. The CAD team started making full models of
                        these mechanisms as well
                        as the robot, and our mechanical team assembled the robot’s chassis and wired it. Finally,
                        on January 11th,
                        Breakerbots
                        participated in the 2025 Central Coast Design Review with ten other local teams. Now, our
                        software team will start
                        programming the robot, and the team will continue refining prototypes for Leviathan.

                    <p class="lead"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year’s game event, Reefscape, started off with a
                        blast revealing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWbxcjlY9JY" target="_blank">a new
                            game</a>,
                        new challenges, and new robot opportunities, and we are eager to step up to the challenge!
                        This fall, we gained many new members, bringing our total to over 40 teammates,
                        all of whom are excited to get the build season started. <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a new game comes new rules, designs, and ideas, so our first task
                        was to become familiar
                        with the rules.
                        In short, our robot must pick up balls and pipes, place those balls and pipes into different
                        goals, and be able to climb
                        onto a hanging cage.
                        Once we understood the game, we came up with designs, strategies, and concepts to help us create
                        the most optimal robot to achieve these tasks.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After kickoff day, we will have 8 ½ weeks before heading off to the
                        Pinnacles Regional to face
                        off against many competitive teams.
                        Be sure to come back next week for the BreakerBots Week 1 Recap!
