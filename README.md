# Breakersite
The Official Breakerbots Website Hosted Through Firebase and Themed Through Bootstrap 4

## Faces
The Breakersite is layed out into faces: A public face targeted at giving general information about the Breakerbots to people and a private face for Breakerbots' member use.

## Public Face
The Public face will be the landing page for [breakerbots.com](breakerbots.com).
It is divided into six sections: about, robots, recognition, upcoming event, sponsors, and contact. All of these sections are easily accessible through the header at the top of the page.

In addition, a team blog as well as information about the Central Coast Regional is available. 

Along with this there is a portal section in the header to bring team members to the private face.

## Private Face
The private face is a tool for 5104 team members. It is focused at increasing productivity of memebers through a variety of systems. These Systems include Item, Task, Team and Event Management along with a Calendar and a place to store Manuals/Instructions.
